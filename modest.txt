This is a pretty straightforward Tetris clone written in C++ using SDL and SDL-Mixer.  I went ahead and tried to make this a pretty big deal - as expansive a game as I've ever written.  Not saying much, I know, but it's got all the features a good Tetris game should have:

* Scoring and high scores
* Saves game options
* Piece lookahead
* Attractive graphics (ha ha)
* Custom music and sound

The source code is a total mess but if you're so inclined, it's included so you can check it out.  There might be some useful bits in there if you look hard enough.

If you like the music enough, just ask me and I'll probably let you stick it in your own projects.

Any questions or comments about this game should be posted on the University of Arkansas Game Development Club's forum.  That way everyone can see yours and my comments and we can all benefit and learn together.  Here's the address:  http://uagdc.webhop.org

I spent a lot of time on this so I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't modify the contents of the ZIP file or try to edit the images and try to pass the game off as your own.  I guess if you wanted to you could modify the block images to your liking, and that's cool - maybe if I ever get bored enough I'll add different skin support.

Thanks for trying my game - I'd love to know what you think.

PS - You can get SDL and SDL-Mixer at http://www.libsdl.org - it's a great library and I wholeheartedly recommend it!
